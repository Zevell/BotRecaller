*Bot Reacaller*

Original mod was made by [cpeosphoros](https://forums.factorio.com/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&u=33391) and can be found [here](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/cpeosphoros/CpeBotRecaller)

All i did was updating the config. :) i Even copied the Readme.

Bots are collect from roboports to the Robot Recaller Chest. Good for upgrading bots.

Should work with all modded bots and roboports, as long as their modder didn't change the internal name of those entities.

Just build a Robot Recaller Chest and set one of its request slots to any kind of logistic bot.

It will pull 1 bot of that kind per second from roboports in the same logistic network into the chest.

If you set more than one kind to be requested, it will only pull the second kind if none of the first is available in the network.

Both limits were set with balancing in mind. If you want a higher output, or to pull more than one kind at a time, just build more chests.
